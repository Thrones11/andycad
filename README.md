# AndyCAD- a CAD engine

AndyCAD is a CAD engine that aim to be an experimental ground for playing with advances in computer graphic, geometry and CAD concepts. The architecture is for now straightforward, and it should be easy for contributors to follow the code. I will keep upgrading it and cleaning up the architecture as much as I can. With the coming of the AR(augmented reality) and AI/deep learning revolution and other exciting technology where CAD is a key component, giving access to CAD engine code base to more developpers is essential.

### Installation:
The current code base is perfectly working for the old visual studio 6 and C++95. As upgrade to C++11 and C++17 is being made and porting to MacOSx and linux is being worked on, I will update the ReadMe.
